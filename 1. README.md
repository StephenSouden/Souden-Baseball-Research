The following is a list of visuals seen on my Free Agent Player Evaluation ShinyApp.

Disclaimer: All data shown is proprietary of Major League Baseball, Fangraphs, Cot's Contracts, and MLB Trade Rumors.

2. Free Agent Metrics
   - Prior 3-Season Performance Table
     - Evaluates a player from 2022-2024 using a variety of metrics. Table is color-coded to reflect performance compared to MLB average.
   - 2024 Percentile Bar Chart
     - Takes same metrics seen in the table and converts them to percentiles for better comparison.
   - Modeled WAR Plot
     - Features 8-year outline of modeled wins above replacement for given player.
     - WAR values are created via bayesian linear modeling and adjusted with an aging curve.
   - Cohort WAR plot
     - Similar to Model plot, execpt this 8-year projection takes the downstream performances of given player's cohort.
     - Cohorts are built for given player using prior 3-year performance, age, position.
   - Average WAR Projection Table
     - Simple table featuring average WAR projections between Linear/Cohort models.
    
3. Free Agent Financials
   - Financial Table
     - Using the previously listed WAR projections, a player's expected free market values are mapped out over an 8-year period.
   - Financials Line Graph
     - Same data as seen in the table. Average annual values are plotted for all projection types.
    
4. Free Agent Comparables
   - Comparables Plot/Table
     - Using prior 3-seasons performance, position, age, builds a list of recent contract comparisons to be used as benchmarks for given player.
   - Recommendation
     - All data shown in the app requires context when evaluating. The recommendation is a short, succinct summary of potential player strategies.
    
5. Model Building Code
   - Example snippet of the dataset manipulation and model building techniques used to build some of the visuals in this app.

6. App Visuals Code
   - Example snippet of some of the visual builds, using various techniques in ggplot() and gt().
